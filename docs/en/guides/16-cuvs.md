# NVIDIA cuVS dense search backend

The `cuvs` backend keeps OpenViking's embedded record store, scalar indexes, sparse retrieval, and recovery logic, while executing dense vector search with NVIDIA cuVS. cuVS 26.06 Python wheels require Python 3.11 or newer.

Install the package matching the host CUDA major version:

```bash
# CUDA 12
pip install -e .
pip install cuvs-cu12 'cupy-cuda12x[ctk]' --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com

# CUDA 13
pip install -e .
pip install cuvs-cu13 'cupy-cuda13x[ctk]' --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com
```

Start with exact brute-force search:

```json
{
  "storage": {
    "workspace": "/data/openviking",
    "vectordb": {
      "backend": "cuvs",
      "distance_metric": "cosine",
      "cuvs": {
        "algorithm": "brute_force",
        "fallback_to_native": true,
        "filter_cache_size": 16
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Set `algorithm` to `cagra` for approximate graph search. `build_params` and `search_params` are passed to cuVS `cagra.IndexParams` and `cagra.SearchParams` respectively.

The initial integration rebuilds the GPU index lazily after an upsert or delete. Common scalar filters are translated to a cuVS bitset prefilter. `filter_cache_size` retains recently reused bitsets on the GPU and invalidates them on mutation; the first use of a new filter still evaluates the predicate against the host-side records. Sparse/hybrid queries and unsupported type-sensitive filters fall back to OpenViking's native local index when `fallback_to_native` is enabled. The canonical vectors remain in the local store and repopulate cuVS after restart.

The `[ctk]` CuPy extra installs the CUDA toolkit headers required by the cuVS
Python interop path, even when the host provides a CUDA driver but no toolkit.

After installation, run `python examples/cuvs_smoke.py` for an exact
GPU-backed write and filtered-search check, or
`python examples/cuvs_smoke.py --algorithm cagra` to exercise the graph index.
Neither command requires an embedding or VLM service.
