"""Recall candidate ranking: server score + L2 leaf boost, no query-token overlap boost.

The OpenViking server's similarity scores for one query typically sit in a narrow band
(about +/-0.01 in practice). A literal query-token overlap bonus of 0.05/token was larger
than that whole band, so it decided the order: memories that merely repeated the query's
words (often raw chat-log events) outranked the semantically closer fact, and memories in a
different language from the query (no shared tokens at all) were pushed out of the top N.
